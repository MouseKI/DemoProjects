+ I designed this project into two parts:
    - The main.o is the compiled code for running the project
    - The functions.o is the compiled code for the product management system functionalities.
    - My project also included a makefile, so you just need to run "make" in the terminal, and run "./store" to start my project.

## [Python Project][Python]
### [Color Panel][Python]
This project uses a Python script to generate a Jupyter Notebook that displays some of my favorite color set collection tables in markdown, which lets users preview the selected color's effects and what the output is going to look like.  Hope this small project you may like or be useful to you in some ways.

## [Terminal Bash Project][Bash]
### [File Helper][Bash]
I programmed a file helper terminal bash script to generate a test file(s) and rename a series of files for my development process; therefore, I could quickly generate dummy test data files or rename files to let my projects be more organized. I also add my profile hyperlinks in the bash script, so that you can click the links from the terminal while executing the script to visit my pages if you are interested in me.
